# Hey everyone!

Wanted to share with you a special project I've been working on recently! 

This is a special DAPP built around an Ethereum Smart Contract I build through BuildSpace.so!

I've been building out smart contracts recently exploring the world of Web 3.0 and it has been awesome plan on sharing a lot of my journey soon and teaching the fundamentals to others including you if you're interested trust me it'll be worth it:)

I decided to challenge myself by building out the Smart Contract Buildspace teaches you and I added in some custom functionality to the contract and I took the UI to the next level to take the contract interaction up a notch

- If you'd like to learn how to build a smart contract I highly recommend to check out the one Buildspace teaches it is a greater starter project to get you introduced into the world of Web 3.0 particularly around the Ethereum blockchain.

You'll learn more about the purpose of the smart contract once you enroll and <strong style="color:#fff">it's free!!!</strong>

And you can see an example of how it works by checking out the unique DAPP(Decentralized Application) I builtðŸ˜‰
